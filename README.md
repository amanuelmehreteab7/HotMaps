# HotMaps

Have you ever felt left out on a dull Friday night, wondering, in fear, where
the HOT place to be is? Alleviate your FOMO with HotMaps. With HotMaps you no
longer need to wonder where THE place to be is. At a click of a button you will
instantly see where people are at, what bar is hopping, where is their
an event you are missing out on, what parks are everyone relaxing at. All these
questions and more are answered with HotMaps.

HotMaps will attempt to graphically display the top venues in multiple categories
on Google Maps with data coming from FourSquare. In addition an anonymous chat
feature will engage the HotMaps community of all the fun going around the city!
